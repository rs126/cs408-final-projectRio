# Web Dev Starter Code

## Project Spec

The overall goal of my website will be to create an online wishlist geared toward the target audience, gamers. Where they can easily track what games they want across different platforms and different mediums.

My approach to this is giving a person their own personal Wishlist that they will use to simply track what they want and where they can go to get it.An example would be if they wanted a retro game for Gameboy advance and wanted to get a cartridge for it, then they would simply enter the name of the retro game, its price, whether its new or used, a picture and a store they either know or believe they can find it. I would also add another section for additional notes about the product from the user. Another example is if they wanted a game on Steam, they could go through the same process of adding details like the name and price but instead enter a link to the game to download for whenever they are ready to purchase. However, all this information will not be required when adding a game to the list. At minimum the user will only be required to put the name of the game they want on their personal list. The website will also track the users budget. Then they marked a game as purchased and the budget would automatically decrement by the amount that the game costed, or if applicable a different price.

I also want to implement a separate page where they can find more great deals for games. On this page the user will be able to find two things, the first will be examples of good deals that I found online. The second thing is custom posts from people detailing the good deals that they found either online or in person at their local retailers. Then I would also have a feature that would allow a user to add what another found and put it in their own wish list by clicking on a button. 

I would also want to implement a feature where the user could sort through the games listed in either their own wish list or in the good deals other people post. This would be in the form of sorting by things like the price or being able to quickly search for the game that they wanted.

One of the features that I would like to implement in the long run or stretch goals would be to add custom reviews for each product. This would enable a person to look at a product's overall rating, and look at some reviews posted by other users to determine if they thought the product was worth their time or money.

Another stretch goal I would add is a feature that would automatically parse through the websites of several vendors including GOG, Steam, Epic Games. Then post those deals on a separate section on the same part of the website where the users had posted the deals they found.
